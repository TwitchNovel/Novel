A long and hard winter lay ahead of us. Call me Ishmael Maynard Keynes and kill everybody who dissents. This is madness of the highest order. I remember when we were legends. 

 "Who dares to interrupt my speech?" Old asked him loudly, 

 “Why would you try to interrupt me?" 

 “I was speaking to my boy who killed our dreams by insulting the king." Curses you incompetent fool! Off with your head! Burn the witch! 

 Ishmael, distraught, turned to zir Lancelot de Bartholomew, his advisor on all things Antifa, and said "Go now. Get me my bean bag you hippie little kid, and tell those russian Gopniks to go get drunk! and bring some Kvass for me too." 

 "Righty-o captain!" 

 With a lot of worry, Lancelot rushed from the room. He never was one to be brave when Ishmael is angry. 

 Old, still upset with Ishy decided to play tagpro but he was really bad. Findadmagus, the greatest ball in all of Chord, totally juked his bally ass in every game! 

 On dark and stormy nights, Ishmael likes to fall asleep to the screams of needles scraping against the bones of dogs like banshees in an echo chamber. Old killed it in a very engaging game of ping pong! she drank gummies daily and ate SpiderMonkey BumJuice XoXoGossipGirl and goes to practice fortnite dances alone 

 With silence as his ally, Ishmael says "Attention all Twitch viewers, I have to tell you something important about Amazon Prime. Did Jeff tell you where the money goes? It funds a secret underground s..." Ishmael falls to the cold floor. Blood spewing from his neck. "Nothing personal, kid." Comes a rasping voice. In Ishmael's place stands Jeff. Appearing as if he had teleported behind Ishmael. <br> <div> <img src= ></div> <div style= class= ></div> <div /> <div /> "Nooooooo!"
